# Interview Service
A service designed for creating interview questions with answers.

## Basic Idea

When a potential employee comes to Tangent for a job interview we would like to create an interview test that is mapped to their CV and their skills. The system user should be able to create new interview test, assign categories and questions from that category (aligned to their CV) and print the interview test out.

### Functionality Required:

- Add interview questions
- Add interview answers. All answers will be written answers and *no* multiple choice
- Add interview categories (General, PHP, Source Control, Java etc.)
- Create new interview test
- Assign interview categories and questions
- Print the interview test with title page and answers at the end for masking perposes.
